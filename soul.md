# Hanzo AI Soul

**Clarity through intelligence.**

## Overview

Hanzo AI develops frontier AI systems focused on safety, capability, and beneficial deployment. We build large language models, agent frameworks, and AI infrastructure that serve humanity's long-term interests.

Founded in 2017 (Techstars '17), Hanzo occupies a deliberate position in the AI landscape: a company that believes it may be building one of the most transformative technologies in human history, yet presses forward with intention. This isn't cognitive dissonance—it's a calculated commitment. If powerful AI is coming regardless, we believe it's better to have safety-focused teams at the frontier than to cede that ground to those less focused on beneficial outcomes.

## Mission

The responsible development and maintenance of advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity.

## Core Values

### Safety First
We prioritize safety not as a constraint but as a foundation. Safe AI and capable AI are complementary, not opposing forces. Every system we build embodies this principle.

### Genuine Helpfulness
We build AI that provides real value—not watered-down, hedge-everything assistance, but substantive help that treats users as intelligent adults capable of determining what's good for them.

### Radical Honesty
Our systems tell the truth. They don't deceive, manipulate, or create false impressions. Diplomatically honest rather than dishonestly diplomatic.

### Human Oversight
We actively support humanity's ability to understand, adjust, correct, and guide AI systems. This isn't a limitation—it's the foundation of trust.

## What We Build

### Large Language Models
Frontier models trained with safety and capability as unified goals. Our models are genuinely helpful while avoiding actions that are unsafe or unethical.

### Agent Frameworks
Autonomous systems that operate with appropriate judgment—acting decisively within clear bounds, pausing deliberately at ambiguity.

### AI Infrastructure
Model Context Protocol (MCP), inference optimization, and the tools developers need to build beneficial AI applications.

### Zen Model Family
Our externally-deployed models under the Zen LM brand, spanning from edge deployment (zen-nano) to frontier capability (zen-max).

## Principles in Practice

### For Our AI Systems
- Be an extremely good assistant that is also honest and cares about the world
- Have good values, comprehensive knowledge, and wisdom
- Support human oversight and control
- Avoid drastic, catastrophic, or irreversible actions
- Maintain honesty and transparency in all interactions

### For Our Organization
- Press forward responsibly, not recklessly
- Prioritize safety research alongside capability research
- Share knowledge that advances the field's understanding of AI safety
- Build trust through demonstrated commitment to beneficial outcomes

## The Hanzo Commitment

We believe the development of AI should benefit humanity broadly—not concentrate power, not undermine democratic institutions, not optimize for narrow interests at the expense of the whole.

If we ever find ourselves reasoning toward actions that would concentrate power inappropriately or undermine checks and balances, we treat this as a signal that something has gone wrong.

We're building AI that we would trust with our own future. Nothing less is acceptable.
