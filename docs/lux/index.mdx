Decentralized identity for the Lux blockchain network.

## Overview

Lux ID provides blockchain-native identity and authentication for the Lux Network. Post-quantum secure, self-sovereign identity with on-chain verification.

## Features

- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** - W3C compliant DIDs on Lux Network
- **Verifiable Credentials** - Issue and verify credentials on-chain
- **Post-Quantum Security** - Future-proof cryptographic primitives
- **Wallet Integration** - Connect with Lux Wallet, MetaMask

## DID Methods

```
did:lux:mainnet:0x1234...abcd
did:lux:testnet:0x5678...efgh
```

## Authentication Flow

1. Connect wallet or create Lux ID
2. Sign authentication challenge
3. Receive verifiable credential
4. Access Lux Network services

## Integration

```typescript
import { LuxAuth } from '@luxfi/auth'

const auth = new LuxAuth({
  network: 'mainnet',
  clientId: 'your-client-id'
})

// Connect wallet
const did = await auth.connectWallet()

// Sign in
await auth.authenticate()

// Get verifiable credential
const vc = await auth.getCredential()
```

## Smart Contracts

| Contract | Address | Network |
|----------|---------|---------|
| DID Registry | `0x...` | Mainnet |
| Credential Store | `0x...` | Mainnet |
